# drupal8_test
Fiddling around with the Drupal 8 module system.

In this repo I will be adding submodules that are implementing the key
drupal development functionality.

The chunks of code that are used here would be tried to be as indipendent 
as possible 
(or possible according to my current knowledge of the Drupal 8 module system).

Primary created for use by compuccino, Berlin, but anyone could use this code.

The project is started and tested on a stable version of Drupal 8, 
(>= Drupal 8.0.1)

Cheers!
